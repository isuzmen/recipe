    <h3>What is Cougito?</h3>
    <p>Coquito is a traditional holiday drink originating from Puerto Rico. In Spanish, coquito means "nutmeg". The drink is coconut-based and enriched with rum. Rich and creamy coquito, often thickened with egg yolk, is similar to eggnog. In fact, it is sometimes referred to as "Puerto Rican eggnog."</p>
    <h3>Ingradients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Evaporated milk: This coquito recipe starts with a can of evaporated milk.</li>
        <li>Eggs: Whisked two egg yolks contribute to the rich, thick, creamy texture.</li>
        <li>Coconut cream : Preserved coconut cream adds richness and gives coquito its distinctive coconut flavor.</li>
        <li>Sweetened condensed milk: Sweetened condensed milk makes everything taste better, including this coquito recipe!</li>
        <li>White rum: The best rum for coquito is white Puerto Rican rum, such as Bacardi. In a pinch, any pleasant-tasting white rum will work.</li>
        <li>Water: Water thins the thick and creamy mixture, making it super pourable.</li>
        <li>Vanilla: A teaspoon of vanilla extract takes the flavor to the next level.</li>
        <li>Spices: Cinnamon and cloves add warmth and comfort.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the evaporated milk and egg yolks in a double boiler until thick.</li>
